## Open source lifecycle

Over the years, we published a _lot_ of open source libraries, tools and examples. This is great. But it also can be confusing when you are trying to decide whether a certain lib might be useful for your project. For your orientation, you can use the ![doc](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-DOC-green.svg) badges that we will continue adding to our repos.
