## Open source lifecycle

Over the years, we published a _lot_ of open source libraries, tools and examples. This is great. But it also can be confusing when you are trying to decide whether a certain lib might be useful for your project. For your orientation, you can use the ![doc](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-DOC-green.svg) badges that we will continue adding to our repos. 

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [![stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-STABLE-green.svg)](https://github.com/holisticon#open-source-lifecycle) | Ready for use, released on maven central, accepts PRs, regular version maintanance, no active development. |
| [![example](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-EXAMPLE-red.svg)](https://github.com/holisticon#open-source-lifecycle) | One time showcase used for a presentation, a training or an article. Usually not maintained regularly. |
| [![incubating](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-INCUBATING-orange.svg)](https://github.com/holisticon#open-source-lifecycle) | This might become the next big thing ... or vanish without further notice. Be careful. Use for inspiration but not in production! Feel free to join forces with the developers if you are interested. |
